 Dynasty RulebookHARD CAP OF $220 (including IR).Soft cap is $200 (minimum payment per franchise, no benefit to teams for not spending to the soft cap)The league has a real money salary cap. Meaning any dollar you spend at the draft or via trade will be calculated towards your FNFL entry fee. We have a Soft and Hard salary cap in effort to infuse more money into the league. Teams may exceed the soft cap of $100 to draft, or trade for, players. Any team that chooses to exceed the soft cap will pay a cap fee associated with the amount they spend above the soft cap.Cap RulesYou may field a roster up to the hard capFor every $1 above the soft cap, teams will be charged three real dollars ($3). This means a team that spends $220 at the auction draft will owe $160 in real money towards the total pot.Payment is determined by addingSalary cap hit at the END OF THE SEASON plus Cap fees ACCRUED DURING THE SEASON (see details below)Cap fees are assessed when a team exceeds the soft cap of $200 during an ACTIVE WEEK. They are calculated by multiplying $3x the amount above the soft cap.Cap Fees Cap fees are the ADDITIONAL payments made above your Soft salary cap hit. If you keep your team under (or at?) the $200 soft cap, you will not owe any cap fees. Calculated by multiplying $5 the amount above the soft capSalary cap fees will be assessed on a weekly basisTeams will NOT be charged twice for exceeding the cap. The one exemption for exceeding the soft cap is if a team makes a trade to exceed the soft cap and makes another move to dip back below it before the first game of the week has started.EXAMPLES for Clarification on Cap Payments and Fees$ owed is calculated by: end of year cap ($200 for every team regardless if you spend under soft cap ) + transaction dues Retirement during contractIf a player retires mid contract, the GM gets cap relief and still owns the player right per contract. If the GM goes over cap and the player returns, the GM is responsible for getting cap compliant before the current weeks game. If a player retires on the last year of his deal, GM owns arbitration right all the way until arbitration players are due. Suspension/ holdout/ any reason to be out other than injury or retirement during contractSuspension/ holdout/ any reason to miss game other than injury or retirement during contractplayers in single or multi year contracts will stay on the team salary. GM does not get cap relief or a roster spot. Injured Reserve and the Salary Cap Players are only eligible for IR if their red flags says “IR, Long Term IR, Short Term IR, Out or Out Indefinitely; IF a player who was on the IR for the previous weeks game, he can stay on IR until that player&apos;s game the present week, assuming that player plays. Players who are on Long Term IR but just listed as OUT still count against your both your salary cap and cap luxury fee hits.Only players who are formally ruled out for the season can go to IR to free up salary cap pre auction. If they’re on IR on a week to week basis with a potential to return later in the season, they count against the cap.RostersAll rosters will consist of 15 starters and 8 bench spots for 18 total players. During the auction draft teams will bid on these players. Each team MUST start the regular season with 18 players. The minimum bid on a player is $1. Since teams must fill an 18 man roster (no empty bench spots allowed), the maximum bid on one player starts at $113 (allowing for players to hit the high end of the hard cap) and drops accordingly.ContractsContracts will be allocated by the general manager before each season begins. After the auction draft teams will decide how many years they want to allocate to each player on their team. Managers will be given a total of 40 years to allocate to each player in any way they see fit with one exception being the maximum term of 5 years.Maximum term: 5 yearsMinimum cost: $1Starters1 QB2 RB4 WR2 TE4 Flex - (1 qb started/ week minimum, 2 qb started/ week maximum) 8 Bench spotsMax Players (roster must be in compliance by season kickoff game)15 Starters8 Bench spotsUnlimited IR (must be doubtful or worse the day of the game)3 QB on main roster (IR and suspension exceptions)5 QB Total (including practice squad)*** qb can be held for bye week replacements or ir, must be dropped tuesday morning after that weekSchedule13 weeks - each team will play their divisions teams 2x and the other division 1 xWeek 14 the league will play the league; the top 5 scoring teams in week 14 will earn a win (Commish will manually do this in Fantrax). Divisions There will 7 teams in each of the two divisions. We will evaluate the teams at the end of the first and second season and make a determination if divisions need to be balanced at a league level. *For the first season we will continually examine the rules and adjust as necessary for the health and well being of the FNFL. Almost every decision will be done through voting by league members. Smaller matters will be handled by the league commissioner. *If there are any issues or questions about the rules please let me know by texting or emailing me. I have thought a lot about the cap rules, and tried to include a lot of examples to help you everyone fully understand the logic behind them. Some things may seem odd to you at first so if you have any questions feel free to ask. - Rocco &amp; JayDivisions will be picked via snake draft annually by the division winners as captains. 1 seed from the previous year will have first pick.Payouts (determined at end of year after final $ owed is totaled)1st Place - 40% 2nd Place - 20%Division Winners - 5% each = 10%Playoff Teams - 5% each = 30%Transaction Fee’s$3 transaction fee per GM involved in tradeWaiver Pickups - The Deo Rule1-8 pickups, $0 per9-15 pickups, $1 per16-24 pickups, $3 per25+ pickups $5 perDraft type: Auction with REAL MONEY Salary Cap3 Strike RuleAny GM who neglects lineup by leaving bye week/ injured player in roster will earn a strike. Once a GM reaches 3 strikes, they pay a $75 penalty that goes into primary pot; the strike carry over every season and do not reset.Guice RuleAny players drafted in the rookie draft who are ruled out for the year they are drafted due to injury prior to week 1 will have their ELC start date moved to the following year. EX-Jason drafts Guice in the 2018 rookie draft, Guice tears acl in preseason, Guice ELC would be starting in 2019 rather than him being on year 2 of his ELC. This rule does not apply to suspensions, retirement or legal issues. This rule is only valid for year one, ELC does not slide if a player is hurt mid ELC or in regular season of ELC year 1. IF RulePer FNHL, an “IF” statement allows GM’s to start a player over an injured player who is deemed out last minute.EX. I’m getting on a plane at 12:45, Phillip Rivers is a game time call, he’s formally ruled out at 12:50. Before the plane takes off, I can announce in groupme “start bortles over river IF rivers is out”Dropped Player Rule/ Free for all SundayAny dropped player must stay on waivers for 24 hours. Any player dropped within 24 hours of their kickoff can be picked up freely. If the site prohibits a pickup in that 24 hour kickoff window (trax always messes this up) post your pickup in GroupMe. Sam RuleWe cannot control the bye weeks, suspensions, injuries and starting jobs of the players signed, and because of this some teams may have to field rosters without starting QBs. QB is the only position of value where a starter is required to accrue points. To maintain fair play throughout the league the QB roster limit will be reduced by 1. Teams may now keep a maximum of 4 QBs on the roster (3 max on active roster). QBs on active roster and minor roster count against max UNLESS they are:1. On a bye 2.

Players on an expiring deal may be dropped for free agents without a buy out. If you drop a player whose deal is not expiring you must buy that player out.FAAB waiver process - Playoff tiebreaker reverse order standingsWaiver claims will be processed every Wednesday night at 10:00pm ESTNon-playoff teams can still make pickups Buy-OutsYou are responsible for paying the FULL salary of any player you buyout during the year. Any player bought out will affect your salary cap moving forward. Buyout cap hits are calculated by taking 40% of the total contract cost over n+1 years, where n = years remaining. All buyouts will be rounded up to the nearest .5 amount to keep clean sheets. Buyouts can be staggered, for example an 8.5 1 year player has penalty of 3.4, one year will be 2 and one year will be 1.5. *** All $1 and 1.5 players will have a .5 per year +1 year buyout hitEXAMPLES:Jerome Bettis had an original deal of 5 years at $10 per year. He has 3 years remaining on that deal when cut.Calculation: $30 x 40% = $12 / 4 yearsCAP HIT: $3 per year over the next 4 years Tommy Maddux had an original deal of 3 years $20 per year. He has 3 years remaining on that deal when cut.Calculation: $60 x 40% = $24 / 4 years CAP HIT: $6 per year over the next 4 yearsCorey Dillon had an original deal of 3 years $15 per year. He’s Cut AFTER the championship game has been played during his 2nd year of the contract but BEFORE the draftCalculation: $15 x 40% = $6 / 2 yearsCAP HIT: $3 over the next 2 seasonsCorey Dillon had an original deal of 3 years $15 per year. Cut in-season during the last year of his dealCalculation: Last year of his deal (AFTER THE DRAFT) has no feeCAP HIT: $0***Buyouts can be staggered over years to ensure you pay the full buyout. EXAMPLE, if a player is 13.5 and 40% buyout is 5.4, we’d round to 5.5 and have $3 cap hit year 1 and 2.5 cap hit on the out yearPractice SquadFirst year player drafts will be held before our free agent auction draft each year. They will consist of 4 rounds and you may only draft eligible players.You may trade your picks. Players drafted via first year player draft will be placed on the practice squad. Practice squad players may move up and down from your active roster to your practice squad freely without going through waivers. If you call a practice squad player up to your main roster you must cut a player from the active roster or do what is necessary to maintain at MOST a 18 man active roster.Prospect Draft LotteryTo prevent tanking, the bottom 4 teams each season will be entered into a draft lottery to determine 1st through 4th pick. The bottom teams will be picked from a hat at random to determine 1st round picks.Free Agent DraftFree agents can be sign for up to 3 years after being selected in the offseason free agent draft. Practice Squad Eligibility RequirementsPlayers who meet rules below are eligible for the practice squadThey have been drafted by or signed to an NFL teamThey are at or below 17 games played in the NFLThey are in FNFL Free AgencyPractice Squad ContractsPractice squad players contracts start immediately.3 year term$1 cap hit (when brought up to main squad)You may drop a practice squad player for a Free agent who meets the requirements above who will take on the term of the practice squad player dropped.Example: I drafted Odell Beckham to my practice squad last year. I drop him this year and pick up Todd Gurley to replace him. Todd Gurley is now on the same contract I dropped with Beckham - the 2nd year of his 3 year term at $1 per year. Practice squad contracts after initial 3 year EL term (grEen contract on sheets):GM’s will get a free arbitration ONE year option after their EL contracts expire, this is an arbitration you get in addition to your 5; after that year expires, GM’s will have the ability to sign the prospect as one of their 5 arby players to a max 3 year contract (yellow contract on sheets)Re-signing PlayersTeams may “re-sign” players via arbitrationPlayers are eligible for arbitration in the final year of an auction draft deal.Players who are in the final year of their arbitrated deal are ineligible for arbitration and must go back into the auction draftArbitration hearings will determine prices for players that have an arbitration tag.Teams may sign up to 3 arbitrated players (unless they trade for other arbitrated players)Arbitration- no limit to how many arbs can be kept****Definition: An “arbitration tag” (Arb tag) allows a manager to keep a player on an expiring contract at an arbitrated price, decided upon by a group of FNFL managersAll prospects on expiring deals receive a “free” arbitration tag and may also be kept. This does not count against the 5 tags and 3 keepers for auction draft expiring dealsEach manager will be able to select 5 players on their team who’s auction draft contracts are expiring for arbitrationA group of managers will get together and determine what would be a fair price for each arbitrated playerAny manager can choose to participate in the process of determining arb pricesThe arb price will take into account all factors contributing to both a player’s intrinsic value and market value within our leagueperformance in past seasonsperformance in the most recent seasonageconsistencymarket valuepositioninjury historyNFL team (i.e. QB situation)potentialAfter the arbitration prices are determined, each manager may select up to 3 players to keep on their team under the determined arbitration priceI.e., they may keep up to 3 of the 5 arbitrated playersThese are the only 3 non-prospect (non-entry-level) players that each team can keep going into next season (aside from those on unexpired contracts)If a manager chooses to use fewer than 3 arb tags, the remaining arb tags do NOT carry over into future offseasonsAll remaining players on expiring deals will go to the free agent auction draftPlayers kept via arbitration can be signed for a maximum of 3 years Trading arbitrated players is allowedIf two teams each receive one of the 5 arbitrated players in a trade, each team will still be allowed to keep 3 of their 5 arbitrated playersIf two teams make a trade where one team receives an arbitrated player, and the other team does not, then:The team receiving the additional arbitrated player may keep an extra (4th) arbitrated playerThe team trading the additional arbitrated player may only keep 2 of his remaining 4 arbitrated players
